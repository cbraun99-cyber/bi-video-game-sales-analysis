## WORKFLOW 1. Set Up Your Machine (DONE in P1)

Proper setup is critical. Follow earlier instructions to set up your machine.

---

## WORKFLOW 2. Set Up Your Project (DONE in P1)

We used these one-time commands when first starting the project.

```shell
uv python pin 3.12
uv venv
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv run pre-commit install
uv run python --version
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```shell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## WORKFLOW 3. Daily Workflow

As we progress, we'll use this daily workflow often.

### 3.1 Git Pull from GitHub

Always start with `git pull` to check for any changes made to the GitHub repo.

```shell
git pull
```

### 3.2 Run Checks as You Work

If we need additional packages, we first add them to pyproject.toml. 
Add pre-commit to pyproject.toml if you haven't already. 

1. Update dependencies (for security and compatibility).
2. Clean unused cached packages to free space.
3. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.
4. Run ruff and fix minor issues.
5. Update pre-commit periodically.
6. Run pre-commit quality checks on all code files (**twice if needed**, the first pass may fix things).
7. Run tests.

In VS Code, open your repository, then open a terminal (Terminal / New Terminal) and run the following commands one at a time to check the code.

```shell
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv cache clean
git add .
uvx ruff check --fix
uvx pre-commit autoupdate
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
git add .
uv run pytest
```

NOTE: The second `git add .` ensures any automatic fixes made by Ruff or pre-commit are included before testing or committing.

### 3.3 Build Project Documentation

Make sure you have current doc dependencies, then build your docs, fix any errors, and serve them locally to test.

```shell
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run mkdocs serve
```

- After running the serve command, the local URL of the docs will be provided. To open the site, press **CTRL and click** the provided link (at the same time) to view the documentation. On a Mac, use **CMD and click**.
- Press **CTRL c** (at the same time) to stop the hosting process.

### 3.4 Execute

This project includes demo code.
Run the data_prep module to confirm everything is working.

In VS Code terminal, run:

```shell
uv run python -m analytics_project.data_prep
```

---

### 3.5 Git add-commit-push to GitHub

Anytime we make working changes to code is a good time to git add-commit-push to GitHub.

1. Stage your changes with git add.
2. Commit your changes with a useful message in quotes.
3. Push your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "describe your change in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and publish your documentation via GitHub Pages.

### 3.6 Modify and Debug

With a working version safe in GitHub, start making changes to the code.

Before starting a new session, remember to do a `git pull` and keep your tools updated.

Each time forward progress is made, remember to git add-commit-push.
